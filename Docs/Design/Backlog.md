# Inspect visualization improvements
    - when editing a task from the visual inspect the task should be selected and the task should be highlighted in the graph
    - when editing a task in the inspect view - I asked for a shelf view or accordion view to be able to see the task details and the task execution history in a more compact way and to be able to navigate between the task details and the task execution history. 
    - Also ehwn editing task you need to show all the tasks properties that a user can edit when creating a task. 
    
    - When inspecting a task that failed - I asked to show the error message and the input and output of the task in a more compact way and to be able to navigate between the input and output of the task. Use accordion view. and make accordion view collapsible. Make 3 accordion views - one for input and one for output and one for sanity tests results showing details of sanity tests is a compact and readable way  

    It shoudl look somethinh like this : 

    Task Name
    Status (Green for Success, Red For Failed, Yellow for Pending etc accoridng to the task status colors) 
    HTTP Response Code 
    Start Time :         Duration :           End Time :
